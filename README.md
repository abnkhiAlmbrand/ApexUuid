## Issue
Often times, we need be able to refer to related records before they have been inserted. Salesforce does not provide a way to generate a unique ID in Apex, such as as GUID/UUID. This repo aims to solve that.

## Goal
* Create a solution that allows developers to generate a unique ID in code that can be used as an external ID text field

## Implementation
--Coming soon--

### Example Implementation: --Coming soon--
